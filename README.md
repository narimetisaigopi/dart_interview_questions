# Dart Interview Questions

1. What is Dart?

> Dart is a client-optimized programming language developed by Google. It is used for building high-performance web, server, and mobile applications.

2. What are the features of Dart?

> * Object-oriented programming language.
> * Strong typing.
> * Supports asynchronous programming.
> * Supports both client-side and server-side development.

3. What are the benefits of using Dart?

> * Easy to learn for developers familiar with Java or JavaScript
> * Faster code execution compared to JavaScript
> * Supports both client-side and server-side development with a single language
> * Rich library support and large developer community

4. What is Flutter and how is it related to Dart?
> Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google that uses Dart as its primary programming language. It is used for building high-performance, beautiful, and responsive mobile applications for iOS and Android.

5. What is the difference between var, dynamic, and Object in Dart?
> * ***var***: In Dart, ***var*** is used to declare a variable whose type will be inferred by the compiler at compile time.
> * ***dynamic***: The ***dynamic*** type is used to declare a variable that can hold any type of value. It is similar to using the Object type in Java or var in JavaScript.
> * ***Object***: The ***Object*** type is the root of the Dart class hierarchy and can hold any object.
6. Can you explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Dart?
> Synchronous programming is a programming model in which a program blocks execution until a task is completed. On the other hand, asynchronous programming is a programming model in which a program continues to execute even while a task is running in the background. Dart supports both synchronous and asynchronous programming, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their needs.

7. What is the purpose of the ***async*** and ***await*** keywords in Dart?
> The ***async*** keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous, which means that the function can run in the background and return a value later. The ***await*** keyword is used to pause the execution of a function until an asynchronous operation is complete. By using the ***async*** and ***await*** keywords, Dart makes it easy to write asynchronous code that is clean and easy to read.

8. Can you explain the difference between a class and an interface in Dart?
> A class is a blueprint for creating objects that define their state and behavior. An interface, on the other hand, is a blueprint for a set of methods that a class must implement. In Dart, a class can implement multiple interfaces and reuse their methods.
